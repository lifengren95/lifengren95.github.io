# Overview

-   Today, I am going to go over a software called `Quarto` that is developed by the same team that developed `R Markdown`. As you can guess for now, they are very similar with slight difference.
-   In this session, I am hoping to go over:
    -   What is `Quarto`, and why we should use it
    -   How to use `Quarto` to generate:
        -   `HTML` documents
        -   `Reveal.js` slides
        -   Quarto website with `GitHub Pages`

## What is Quarto

-   Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system to create dynamic content with `Python`, `R`, `Stata`, `Julia` with engines `Jupyter`, `Knitr`, and `Observable`.

-   Just like `R Markdown`, `Quarto` uses `PanDoc` to convert `Markdown` to `LaTex`, `HTML`, `PDF`, `Word`, etc.

-   In short: One document (`.qmd`), multiple languages, multiple outputs.

## Why Quarto?

-   To keep your code and document in one place and make it reproducible. Most importantly, to make it open-sourced and shareable.

-   What if I am already using `R Markdown`, do I need to switch?

    -   Based on your needs. There are many discussions on this, and I am providing some blogs and articles that you can read to make your own decision.

## Quarto Preview

@fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: "Temperature and ozone level."
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess"
)
```

## Install Quarto

To play with `Quarto`, you should firstly download Quarto from [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), install it, and choose your favorite IDE to write `Quarto` documents. I am using `VS Code` with `Quarto` extension installed to show the demo today.

-   If you are using `R Studio`, once you installed `Quarto`, you do not need any extra steps. Just restart your `R Studio` and you are good to go.

-   In the `VS Code` IDE, you need to install `Quarto` extension in the `Extensions` marketplace.

# Generate your first `Quarto` document

As I mentioned above, `Quarto` can support many output formats. Today, I am going to show you how to generate `HTML` documents, `Reveal.js` slides, and `Quarto` website with `GitHub Pages`. For a full list of reference, please visit this page: <https://quarto.org/docs/guide/>. 

## Quarto Notebook

-   Quarto provides a `Notebook Editor` and a `Visual Editor` mode to write the document. (DEMO)

    ![](img/notebook_editor.png){width="50%"}
    ![](img/visual_editor.png){width="50%"}

-   It can be rendered into different type of outputs. (DEMO for `HTML`, `PDF`, `Word`)
    - For now, I will keep rendering it into `HTML` format.

- Almost all syntax are the same for `R Markdown` and `Quarto` because they are based on `Markdown`. So, I won't go over the syntax a lot today. You can find more information here: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html>

- `YAML` header has some differences. Here is an example:

| RMarkdown        | Quarto   |
|------------------|----------|
| output: html_document | format: html |
| output: pdf_document  | format: pdf  |
| output: word_document | format: docx |
| `underscore`: `_` (e.g.: `number_sections: true`)| `dash`: `-` (e.g.: `number-sections: true`)|
|Rerender all the code| Rerender only when source changes|

New Features in `Quarto`'s `YAML` header:
```{r}
#| eval: false 
execute:
  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes
```

- Code Chunk options are changing

::: {.panel-tabset}

### RMarkdown

```{r}
#| eval: false
    ```{r setup, include=FALSE}
    ```
```

### Quarto

```{r}
#| eval: false
    ```{r}
    #| label: "setup"
    #| include: false
    ```
```

## Weave `Stata`, `R`, and `Python` into one Document

### Run Stata Code in Python and R

Since `Quarto` can choose the corresponding language engine based on the code chunk's language, we can run `Stata` code in `Python` and `R` code chunks to weave all three languages coding into one document.

::: panel-tabset
#### Run Stata in `Python`

**Step 1:** Install `pystata`, and `stata_setup` package using `pip` or `conda`, or `mamba`, etc. (Here is an example using `pip`)

```{python}
#| label: install
#| eval: false
pip install pystata
pip install stata_setup
```

**Step 2:** Point the `stata_setup` to your Stata installation directory

-   Open Stata, and type `display c(sysdir_stata)` in the command window.
-   Copy the output and paste it in the `stata_setup.config()` function like below.

```{python}
#| label: modelling
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| code-line-numbers: "145"
import stata_setup
stata_setup.config('/Applications/Stata/', 'mp')
```

**Step 3:** Run Stata code in Python

```{python}
#| label: test
#| echo: true
#| message: false

from pystata import stata

stata.run('''
sysuse auto, clear
summarize
reg mpg price i.foreign
ereturn list
''')
```

#### Run Stata in `R`

```{r}
library(Statamarkdown)
stataexe <- "/Applications/Stata/StataMP.app/Contents/MacOS/StataMP"
knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path=list(stata=stataexe))
```

```{stata}
sysuse auto, clear
summarize
reg mpg price i.foreign
ereturn list
```

# `Reveal.js` slides

I normally has a document first and then copy and paste it into a new `Quarto` document to generate `Reveal.js` slides. But you can also just change a few things in the `YAML` header to generate `Reveal.js` slides.

The key thing we need to modify is the `format` in the `YAML` header. Here is an example:

```{r}
#| eval: false
---
title: "Introduction to Quarto"
author: "Lifeng Ren"
date: "09-13-2023"
format: 
    revealjs: # revealjs slides
        theme: default # default, beige, sky, night, serif, simple, solarized
        chalkboard: true # add a chalkboard to the slides
        scrollable: true # make the slides scrollable: this is useful for long slides (or sometimes you directly change the yaml header from the html document)
---
```

## Key Features

- Incremental Lists

```{r}
#| eval: false
## Slide 1
::: {.incremental}
-   Item 1
-   Item 2
:::
```

- Multiple Columns

```{r}
#| eval: false
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
Left column
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
Right column
:::

::::
```

- Code Highlight

Suppose we would like to highlight the following code

  - `ax.plot(theta, r)`
  - `x.grid(True)`

We could use the following code to highlight the code in a presentation

```{r}
#| eval: false
    ```{.python code-line-numbers="7,9"}
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
    theta = 2 * np.pi * r
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
    ax.plot(theta, r)
    ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
    x.grid(True)
    plt.show()
    ```
```


# Quarto website with `GitHub Pages`

## Personal Website (DEMO)

In order to generate a personal website hosted by GitHub, we need to do the following things:

- A github account

- Create a new repository with the name of `username.github.io` (e.g.: `lfr00154.github.io`)
  - If you already have your personal website and you can add create a repository with a different name and link this repository to your personal website. For example, I would use `quarto_demosite` as the repository name.

- Create a new `Quarto` website project.
  - In the `_quarto.yml` file, add `output-dir: docs` under the `project` section. 
  - Render this file and there shall be a local static website shown on your IDE/browser.

- Go to GitHub and upload the whole project to the repository you just created.

- Go to the repository's `Settings` and scroll down to the `GitHub Pages` section. Choose `main branch` - `docs`, as the source and click `Save`. Then you will see the link to your personal website.
